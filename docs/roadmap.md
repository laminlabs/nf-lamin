# Roadmap

We have several features planned for future releases of the `nf-lamin` plugin:

- **Input Artifact Registration**: Automatically register input files as artifacts and link them to the run.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Generate more detailed reports and visualizations of workflow runs.
- **Support lamin:// URIs**: Allow users to specify input files using `lamin://` URIs for better integration with LaminDB.
  Example: `lamin://your-organization/your-instance/artifact/1234567890abcdef`

See the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/laminlabs/nf-lamin/issues) for more details and to contribute ideas or feedback.
